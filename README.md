# No Coin
No coin is a tiny browser extension aiming to block coin miners such as Coinhive.


You can grab the extension from the Opera Web Store: https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/no-coin/?display=en

### Why?
Even though I think using coin mining in browser to monetize content is a great idea, abusing it is not. Some websites are running it during the entire browsing session which results in high consumption of your computers resources. I do believe that using it occasionally such as for the proof of work of a captcha is OK. But for an entire browsing session, the user should have the choice to opt-in which is the aim of this extension.

### How does it work?
The extension is simply blocking a list of blacklisted domains in *blacklist.txt*. Clicking on the icon will display you a button to pause/unpause No Coin. If you are aware of any scripts or services that provide coin mining the browser, please submit a PR.
